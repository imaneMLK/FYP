\uc0\u55357 \u57003  [ DO NOT TRUST UNVERIFIED \'93RECOVERY EXPERTS\'94 ]\
\
You may try to recover your data on your own or with a security firm. However, we strongly advise against involving third parties who are not officially trusted by you.\
\
Do not share your device ID with untrusted third parties. The device ID is an identifier that proves that you are a victim.\
\
Some so-called \'93recovery experts\'94 will ask for your Device ID. They will then reach us pretending to be you, get a test decryption from us, and act like they did it themselves. They\'92ll show you the decrypted file, make you believe they can recover everything, and take your money.\
\
In the end, they disappear. You lose time, money, and trust.\
\
Your Device ID means nothing to them technically \'97 but it helps them fool you.\
\
We are the only ones with the keys. Don\'92t waste your time or budget chasing illusions.\
\
\
\uc0\u9888 \u65039  [ DO NOT ATTEMPT DIY DECRYPTION ]\
\
You can try recovery attempts with your own tools or with trusted providers.  \
But we strongly recommend that you **create backups first**.\
\
If you damage or overwrite any encrypted files, not even we can restore them.\
\
No tool, no expert, and no government can break our encryption without the key.\
\
\
\uc0\u9989  [ WHY CHOOSE US ]\
\
We are professionals.  \
If anyone else or any organization claims to be able to decrypt it, it is a scam.\
The strength of the encryption makes it impossible for anyone other than us to decrypt it.\
\
The sooner you reach us, the lower the cost \'97 and the faster your business can get back on track.\
\
**We are the only ones who can actually solve this.**\
\
Act quickly. Every hour counts.\
reach us now to begin the recovery. Time is running out.\
